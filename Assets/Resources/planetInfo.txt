Sun [Sol]
Mass: 332,468.18 Earths
Radius: 695,508 km
Density: 1.409 g/cm^3
Rotation Period: 25.3800
Orbital Period: 230 M yr
Avg distance to Primary: 28,000 ly
------
Contains 99.86% of the mass of the
Solar System. The yellow color of
the sun is related to its heat.
The temperature determines the
color, with cooler being darker
and redder, and hotter meaning
brighter and bluer.

Mercury
Mass: 3.302 x 10^23 kg
            0.0553 Earths
Radius: 2,440.53 km
Density: 5.427 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 58.646 days
Orbital Period: 87.96 days
Avg distance to Sun: 57.9 M km
------
With essentially no atmosphere,
the side facing the sun is super
hot, while the side away is super
cold. It is also heavily cratered
and scarred. Poor Mercury.

200
Venus
Mass: 4.869 x 10^23 kg
            0.8153 Earths
Radius: 6,051.80 km
Density: 5.243 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 243.019 days
Orbital Period: 224.70 days
Avg distance to Sun: 108.2 M km
------
Venus has an atmosphere of CO2 and
sulfuric acid. Due to this thick
atmosphere, it is the hottest
planet in the solar system.
It also spins in retrograde.

300
Earth
Mass: 5.972 * 10^24 kg
Radius: 6,378.14 km
Density: 5.515 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 0.9973 days
Orbital Period: 365.25 days
Avg distance to Sun: 149.6 M km
------
The Earth's atmosphere and
magnetic field protect us from
the dangers of the sun.
It is the only planet known to
host life so far...

301
Moon [Luna]
Mass: 7.348 * 10^22 kg
            0.0123 Earths
Radius: 1,737.10 km
Density: 3.346 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 27.32 days
Orbital Period: 27.32 days
Avg distance to Earth: 384,400 km
------
As Earth's moon orbits Earth, it
rotates in a way that it looks like
it's always facing Earth. However,
the moon does "wobble" a bit,
allowing us to see a portion of the
other side over time.

400
Mars
Mass: 6.419 * 10^23 kg
            0.1075 Earths
Radius: 3,396.19 km
Density: 3.933 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 1.026 days
Orbital Period: 686.98 days
Avg distance to Sun: 227.9 M km
------
Has the largest volcano in the
solar system, Olympus Mons, which
is 3x taller than Mt Everest.
The planet also contains the
biggest canyon, Valles Marineris.
####

500
Jupiter
Mass: 1.899 * 10^27 kg
            317.93 Earths
Radius: 71,492 km
Density: 1.326 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 0.4135 days
Orbital Period: 4,332.82 days
Avg distance to Sun: 778.4 M km
------
Jupiter has more than 80 reported
moons, the most in the system.
Jupiter also has the largest
ocean, being made out of cold
liquid hydrogen.
####

600
Saturn
Mass: 5.685 * 10^26 kg
            95.20 Earths
Radius: 60,268 km
Density: 0.687 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 0.4440 days
Orbital Period: 10,759.22 days
Avg distance to Sun: 1426.7 M km
------
Saturn has less density that other
gas / ice giants due to increased
hydrogen and helium, along with
a less dense ice core. Its rings
are also made out of ice rather
than the rings of other giants.
####

700
Uranus
Mass: 8.685 * 10^25
            14.54 Earths
Radius: 25,559 km
Density: 1.270 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 0.7183 days
Orbital Period: 30,685.40 days
Avg distance to Sun: 2871.0 M km
------
The only planet in the sol system
that rotates on its side, allowing
it to be the butt of all jokes.
Like Venus, it also rotates in
retrograde.
####

800
Neptune
Mass: 1.024 * 10^26
            17.15 Earths
Radius: 24,764 km
Density: 1.638 g/cm^3
Rotational Period: 0.6713 days
Orbital Period: 60,190.03 days
Avg distance to Sun: 4498.3 M km
------
As an ice giant like Uranus, it
contains mostly water, ammonia, and
methane, unlike the gas giants with
mostly helium and hydrogen.
